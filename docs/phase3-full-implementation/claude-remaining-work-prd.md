- âœ… Documentation: 5 points
- âœ… All Required Deliverables: 0 point deductions

### Stretch Goal (95-100 points):
- All of above +
- 5-10 bonus points from innovation/polish/technical excellence

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Advanced AI Capability** - Most complex remaining work
   - Mitigation: Start immediately, choose simpler option if needed
   
2. **Demo Video Quality** - Can lose 15 points
   - Mitigation: Allocate 2 full days, have backup equipment

3. **Performance Optimization** - Could impact multiple rubric sections
   - Mitigation: Profile early, focus on quick wins (image caching, virtualization)

### Medium Risk Items
1. **Documentation** - Time-consuming
   - Mitigation: Document as you build, use templates

2. **Deployment Issues** - Last-minute problems
   - Mitigation: Test deployment process mid-week

## Questions to Clarify

Before starting, confirm:
1. Which advanced AI capability to implement? (Multi-Step Agent recommended for "wow factor")
2. Current performance metrics (message delivery time, scroll FPS)?
3. Any known issues with current implementation?
4. Which bonus features align best with your strengths?
