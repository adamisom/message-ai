  ```typescript
  export async function suggestMeetingTimes(
    conversationId: string

- [ ] Icon: calendar or clock icon
- [ ] Add prop: `onOpenMeetingScheduler`
- [ ] Position after "Decisions" button

**app/chat/[id].tsx:**
- [ ] Import `MeetingSchedulerModal`

- Opens modal correctly
- Modal closes properly
- Works in both direct and group chats

---

### Task 1.5: Deploy and Test Meeting Scheduler
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Deploy Cloud Functions: `cd functions && npm run build && firebase deploy --only functions`
- [ ] Test scenarios:
  1. **Happy path:** Conversation about scheduling → Click button → See 3 suggestions
  2. **No availability:** General conversation → Click button → See generic suggestions
  3. **Specific times mentioned:** "Let's meet Tuesday at 2pm" → See suggestion around that time
  4. **Multiple participants:** Group chat → All participants included in suggestions
- [ ] Verify response time <5 seconds
- [ ] Test error handling:
  - Rate limit (make 50+ calls)
  - Network error (airplane mode)

## Phase 2: Core Messaging Polish
**Time:** 1.5 hours

### Task 2.1: Fix Typing Indicator Persistence (UX Polish)
**Files:** `app/chat/[id].tsx`  
**Time:** 30 minutes

**Problem:** Typing indicators flash briefly and disappear because stale Firestore documents aren't cleaned up.

**Solution:** Client-side cleanup timer that removes typing indicators after 3 seconds of no updates.

- [ ] Add cleanup logic in typing indicators listener (chat screen)
- [ ] Track last update time for each typing user
- [ ] Set 3-second timer to filter out stale indicators
- [ ] Clear timers on component unmount
- [ ] Test: User types → stops → indicator persists for ~3 seconds → disappears

**Acceptance:**
- Typing indicator shows while actively typing
- Persists for 3 seconds after user stops typing
- Gracefully handles multiple users typing
- No stale indicators lingering

---

### Task 2.2: Add Group Chat Read Receipt Details
**Files:** `app/chat/[id].tsx`, `components/MessageList.tsx`, `components/MessageBubble.tsx`  
**Time:** 1 hour
**File:** `types/index.ts`  
**Time:** 5 minutes

- [ ] Verify `Conversation` type includes `lastRead` and `lastReadAt` maps
- [ ] No changes needed (already implemented based on code review)

---

### Task 2.2: Create Read Details Display Logic
**File:** `app/chat/[id].tsx`  
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Add new function `getReadDetails` (similar to existing `getReadStatus`):
  ```typescript
  const getReadDetails = (message: Message): {
    readBy: Array<{ uid: string; displayName: string }>;
    unreadBy: Array<{ uid: string; displayName: string }>;
  } | null => {
    // Only for group chats and own messages
    // Return list of who read and who didn't
  }
  ```
- [ ] Logic:
  - Return `null` if not group chat or not own message
  - Check each participant's `lastRead` timestamp
  - Compare with message timestamp
  - Return arrays of read/unread participants

**Acceptance:**
- Function returns correct read status
- Handles all edge cases
- Performance is good (no unnecessary calculations)

---

### Task 2.3: Update MessageBubble Component
**File:** `components/MessageBubble.tsx`  
**Time:** 25 minutes

- [ ] Read current `MessageBubble.tsx` implementation
- [ ] Add prop: `readDetails?: { readBy: ParticipantInfo[]; unreadBy: ParticipantInfo[] } | null`
- [ ] Add expandable section below message:
  - Show on tap or always visible (design decision)
  - Display: "Read by Alice, Bob" (if some read)
  - Display: "Read by all" (if everyone read)
  - Display: "Delivered" (if none read)
  - Small, subtle text (gray, smaller font)
- [ ] Only render if `readDetails` is not null (i.e., group chat + own message)

**Acceptance:**
- Read details display correctly
- Only shows for appropriate messages
- Updates in real-time
- Doesn't clutter UI

---

### Task 2.4: Connect Read Details to Chat Screen
**File:** `app/chat/[id].tsx`  
**Time:** 10 minutes

- [ ] Pass `getReadDetails` function to `MessageList`
- [ ] Update `MessageList` to pass read details to `MessageBubble`
- [ ] Test with existing group chat conversations

**Acceptance:**
- Read details appear in group chats
- Real-time updates work
- Performance is unaffected

---

## Phase 3: Performance Test Data & Benchmarking
**Time:** 1.5 hours

### Task 3.1: Create Large Conversation Script
**File:** `scripts/populateLargeConversation.js`  
**Time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] Create new script file
- [ ] Configuration:
  - `NUM_MESSAGES = 1500`
  - `conversationId = 'perf-test-1500'`
  - 4 participants
  - Messages spread over 2 weeks
- [ ] Implementation:
  - Get or create conversation
  - Generate realistic message content (mix of short/long)
  - Batch write in groups of 500 (Firestore limit)
  - Use realistic timestamps (not all at once)
  - Include variety: questions, statements, action items, decisions
  - Mark some as priority
- [ ] Add cleanup function to delete test conversation
- [ ] Add to `package.json` scripts:
  ```json
  "populate:large": "node scripts/populateLargeConversation.js",
  "cleanup:large": "node scripts/populateLargeConversation.js --cleanup"
  ```

**Acceptance:**
- Script creates 1500 messages successfully
- Messages have realistic content and timestamps
- Conversation appears in app
- Cleanup script removes all test data

---

### Task 3.2: Add Performance Timing Logs
**Time:** 30 minutes

**File:** `app/chat/[id].tsx`
- [ ] Add timing for message delivery:
  ```typescript
  // In sendMessage, before addDoc:
  const sendStartTime = Date.now();
  
  // In onSnapshot callback:
  const deliveryTime = Date.now() - sendStartTime;
  console.log(`⚡ Message delivery time: ${deliveryTime}ms`);
  ```

**File:** `app/_layout.tsx`
- [ ] Add timing for app launch:
  ```typescript
  // At top of file:
  const appStartTime = Date.now();
  
  // After initial load completes:
  const launchTime = Date.now() - appStartTime;
  console.log(`🚀 App launch time: ${launchTime}ms`);
  ```

**File:** `components/MessageList.tsx`
- [ ] Add timing for message list render:
  ```typescript
  const renderStartTime = useRef(Date.now());
  
  useEffect(() => {
    if (messages.length > 0) {
      const renderTime = Date.now() - renderStartTime.current;
      console.log(`📜 Message list render time: ${renderTime}ms (${messages.length} messages)`);
    }
  }, [messages.length]);
  ```

**File:** `services/aiService.ts`
- [ ] Add timing for each AI feature:
  ```typescript
  // In callAIFeatureWithTimeout:
  const startTime = Date.now();
  const result = await Promise.race([functionPromise, timeoutPromise]);
  const responseTime = Date.now() - startTime;
  console.log(`🤖 ${functionName} response time: ${responseTime}ms`);
  ```

**Acceptance:**
- All timing logs added
- Logs are clear and informative
- No performance impact from logging

---

- [ ] Run script to create 1500-message conversation
- [ ] Open conversation and record metrics:
  1. **Message delivery time:** Send message, check console logs
  2. **App launch time:** Force quit, relaunch, check console logs
  3. **Scroll performance:** Enable Perf Monitor, scroll through messages, record FPS
  4. **Message list render time:** Open conversation, check console logs
  5. **AI feature response times:** Test each feature, check console logs
- [ ] Document results in markdown table
- [ ] Identify any issues or bottlenecks
- [ ] If performance is poor, apply quick fixes:
