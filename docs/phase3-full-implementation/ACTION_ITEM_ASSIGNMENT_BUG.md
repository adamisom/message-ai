# Action Item Assignment Bug - Summary for Next Chat

## ‚úÖ Completed & Working

1. **Proactive Meeting Scheduler** (Advanced AI) - Fully working, deployed Cloud Function
2. **Group Chat Read Receipts** - Shows "Read by Alice, Bob" below messages
3. **Typing Indicator Persistence** - Now persists for 2 seconds minimum
4. **Search Date Display** - Fixed "Invalid Date" by handling Firestore `_seconds`/`_nanoseconds` format
5. **Action Item Sorting** - Now sorted by priority (high, medium, low)

## ‚ùå Still Broken: Manual Action Item Assignment

### Problem

**File:** `/Users/adamisom/Desktop/message-ai/components/ActionItemsModal.tsx`

The "‚ûï Assign" button opens a modal with participant names, but clicking a name does nothing. Debug logs show `itemToAssignRef.current` and `itemToAssign` state are both `null`/`undefined` when the `Pressable` onPress fires.

### What We've Tried

1. Using `e.stopPropagation()` on inner `TouchableOpacity`
2. Switching to `Pressable` with `pointerEvents="box-none"`
3. Using `useRef` instead of state to avoid closure issues
4. Moving ref clearing to after optimistic update

### Root Cause Hypothesis

There's a React Native modal event handling issue where nested `Modal` components or the modal lifecycle is interfering with touch events and/or causing the ref to be cleared before the `onPress` handler executes.

### Files Involved

- `/Users/adamisom/Desktop/message-ai/components/ActionItemsModal.tsx` (lines 115-167, 270-300)
- `/Users/adamisom/Desktop/message-ai/services/aiService.ts` (has working `assignActionItem` API function)

### Next Steps to Try

1. Use a completely different UI pattern (e.g., dropdown picker instead of nested modal)
2. Debug the exact timing of when `itemToAssignRef.current` gets set vs. when it gets cleared
3. Consider using a library like `react-native-picker-select` for the assignment UI
