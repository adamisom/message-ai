# AI Features - Quick Smoke Tests

**Purpose:** Fast manual testing to verify all 5 AI features work end-to-end.  
**Time:** ~15 minutes

---

## Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Deploy Backend:**
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:indexes,firestore:rules
   ```

2. **Populate Test Data:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/populateTestData.js
   ```
   Save the conversation IDs printed at the end.

3. **Wait 10 minutes** for message embeddings to process (required for semantic search).

4. **Run App:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

5. **Login** as one of your test users and open a test conversation.

## Feature Tests (10 minutes)

### 1. Priority Detection ⚡ (Auto-runs)

**Test:** Send messages with different priorities

1. Send: `URGENT: Server is down!!!`
   - [ ] **Instantly** see 🔴 red badge next to message
   
2. Send: `lol thanks`
   - [ ] **No badge** (low priority, expected)

3. Send: `Meeting at 3pm today`
   - [ ] **No badge** or 🟡 yellow badge (medium/unknown)

**✅ Pass:** High priority shows red badge, low priority shows nothing

  - [ ] Each result shows: sender, date, preview, match %

**Test 2: No Results**
- Type: `xyzabc123notfound` → Search
  - [ ] Shows "No messages found" (no crash)

**Test 3: Recent Message (Local Search)**
- Send new message: `elephantTest123`
- Immediately search for: `elephantTest123`
  - [ ] Result appears with "📍 Recent" badge

**Test 4: Jump to Message**
- Search for any message → Tap result
  - [ ] Modal closes, scrolls to message, highlights it for 2 seconds

**✅ Pass:** Search works, handles errors, jump-to-message works

### 3. Thread Summarization 📝

**Open:** AI menu → Summarize Thread

**Test 1: Generate Summary**
- Select **50 messages** → Wait
  - [ ] Loading: "Analyzing 50 messages..."
  - [ ] After 3 seconds: "Still working on it..." (progressive loading)
  - [ ] Summary appears in < 30 seconds
  - [ ] Shows 2-4 sentence summary
  - [ ] Shows 3-10 key points
  - [ ] Footer: "Summary generated from 50 messages"

**Test 2: Caching**
- Close modal → Reopen → Select **50 messages**
  - [ ] Summary appears **instantly** (< 1 second, cached)

**Test 3: Different Message Count**
- Select **25 messages** → Wait
  - [ ] New summary generated (different from 50-message summary)

**✅ Pass:** Summary generates, caching works, different counts work

---

### 4. Action Items ✅

**Open:** AI menu → Action Items

**Test 1: Extraction**
- Wait for extraction
  - [ ] Loading: "Scanning for action items..."
  - [ ] Items appear in < 30 seconds
  - [ ] Each item shows: text, checkbox, priority color, assignee (if any)

**Test 2: Toggle Completion**
- Tap checkbox on pending item
  - [ ] Checkbox fills instantly (optimistic update)
  - [ ] Text gets strikethrough
  - [ ] Color changes to gray

**Test 3: Persistence**
- Close modal → Reopen
  - [ ] Completed item still shows as completed
  - [ ] Status persisted to Firestore

**Test 4: Uncomplete**
- Tap checkbox on completed item
  - [ ] Checkbox empties, strikethrough removed

**Test 5: Empty State**
- Use conversation with no action items (e.g., "Casual Weekend Chat")
  - [ ] Shows ✓ icon, "No action items found"

**✅ Pass:** Items extracted, checkboxes work, persistence works

---

### 5. Decisions 💡 (Group Chats Only)

**Open:** AI menu → Decisions

**Test 1: Visibility**
- In **direct chat**: Menu shows 4 items (no Decisions)
- In **group chat**: Menu shows 5 items (includes Decisions)

**Test 2: Extraction (Group Chat)**
- Open Decisions in group chat
  - [ ] Loading: "Analyzing decisions..."
  - [ ] Decisions appear in < 30 seconds
  - [ ] Each shows: date, decision text, context, confidence %, participant count
  - [ ] Timeline UI (dots and lines) visible
  - [ ] Confidence colors: 90%+=green, 80-89%=light green, <80%=orange

**Test 3: Empty State**
- Use conversation with no clear decisions
  - [ ] Shows 💡 icon, "No decisions found"

**✅ Pass:** Only in group chats, extracts correctly, timeline displays

---

## Error Handling (2 minutes)

### Network Errors
1. Turn on **Airplane Mode**
2. Try any AI feature
   - [ ] Error: "Network error. Please check your connection..."
   - [ ] **Retry button** appears
3. Turn off Airplane Mode → Tap Retry
   - [ ] Feature works

**✅ Pass:** Errors handled gracefully with retry

---

### Progressive Loading
1. Open **Summarize Thread** (with slow/normal connection)
   - [ ] 0-3 seconds: "This may take a few seconds"
   - [ ] 3+ seconds: "Still working on it, thanks for your patience..."

**✅ Pass:** Loading message updates after 3 seconds

2. Close Search → Open AI menu → Tap Cancel
   - [ ] Menu closes smoothly
3. Rapidly open/close modals
   - [ ] No crashes or UI glitches

**✅ Pass:** Modals transition smoothly

## Integration Tests (Optional)

**Run automated integration tests against Firebase emulator:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start emulator
firebase emulators:start

# Terminal 2: Run tests  
npm run test:integration
```

**Expected:** ~20 tests pass, verifying:
- Rate limiting (concurrent requests, hourly/monthly limits, hour resets)
- Caching (hits/misses, age/message-count invalidation)
- Security (access control, participant verification, result filtering)

See `docs/phase2-ai-spike/INTEGRATION_TESTS.md` for details.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **No search results?** | Wait 10 minutes after sending messages for embeddings to process. Check Pinecone dashboard for vector count. |
| **"AI feature not available"?** | Deploy functions: `firebase deploy --only functions` |
| **"Rate limit exceeded"?** | Hit 50/hour or 1000/month limit. Wait or clear usage doc in Firestore. |
| **Functions timeout?** | Check API keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, PINECONE_API_KEY). Check Firebase logs: `firebase functions:log` |
| **"FAILED_PRECONDITION"?** | Deploy indexes: `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes` (wait 5-10 min to build) |
| **Decisions not showing?** | Only visible in group chats (3+ participants). Check conversation type. |
| **Action items not persisting?** | Check Firestore rules deployed. Check browser console for errors. |
