## Notes & Blockers

Use this space to track issues, decisions, or blockers during development:

```
Example:
- [Date/Time] Issue: Firebase connection error
  Solution: Updated .env with correct credentials

- [Date/Time] Decision: Using Firebase Web SDK instead of Native SDK
  Reason: Easier setup for MVP

- [Date/Time] Blocker: Android emulator won't launch
  Status: Resolved - Allocated more RAM
```
