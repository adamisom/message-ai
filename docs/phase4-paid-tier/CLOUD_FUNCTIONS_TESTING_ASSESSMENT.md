---

## High-Value Testing Opportunities

### Priority 1: Critical Business Logic (MUST TEST)

#### **A. `canAccessAIFeatures` - AI Feature Gating**
**Why Critical**: Core monetization logic. If broken, could give free users paid features (revenue loss) or deny paid users access (customer churn).

**High-Value Test Cases**:
1. ✅ **Pro user has access** (paid subscriber check)
2. ✅ **Trial user has access** (5-day trial check)
3. ✅ **Expired trial user denied** (trial expiration)
4. ✅ **Workspace member has access** (workspace membership check)
5. ✅ **Workspace member denied when payment lapsed** (workspace.isActive check)
6. ✅ **Free user (no trial) denied** (baseline access control)
7. ✅ **Returns correct trial days remaining** (UX accuracy)

**Testing Approach**: Unit tests with mocked Firestore (similar to existing `functions/src/__tests__/` pattern)

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (7 test cases, mock setup)

---

#### **B. `createWorkspace` - Workspace Creation**
**Why Critical**: Complex validation, multiple failure modes, transaction logic. Directly tied to revenue (Pro-only feature).

**High-Value Test Cases**:
1. ✅ **Pro user can create workspace** (happy path)
2. ✅ **Free user blocked** (monetization enforcement)
3. ✅ **Trial user blocked** (trial limitation)
4. ✅ **Spam-banned user blocked** (spam prevention)
5. ✅ **5 workspace limit enforced** (resource exhaustion)
6. ✅ **Duplicate name rejection (per user)** (data integrity)
7. ✅ **Invalid maxUsers values rejected** (2-25 range validation)
8. ✅ **Transaction atomicity** (workspace + user update together)
9. ✅ **Initial member invitations sent** (optional feature)

**Testing Approach**: Unit tests with mocked Firestore transactions

**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 hours (9 test cases, complex mocking)

---

#### **C. `reportWorkspaceInvitationSpam` - Spam System**
**Why Critical**: Complex strike decay logic (1-month decay), auto-ban at 5 strikes. If broken, could ban innocent users or fail to ban spammers.

**High-Value Test Cases**:
1. ✅ **Strike added correctly** (increment logic)
2. ✅ **5th strike triggers ban** (auto-ban threshold)
3. ✅ **Old strikes (>1 month) removed** (decay logic)
4. ✅ **Notification sent at 3rd/4th strike** (warning system)
5. ✅ **Ban notification sent at 5th strike** (ban alert)
6. ✅ **Already-banned user doesn't get duplicate notification** (idempotency)
7. ✅ **Transaction atomicity** (strike + invitation update together)

**Testing Approach**: Unit tests with time-based mocking (critical for decay logic)

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours (7 test cases, time-based scenarios)

---

### Priority 2: Important Business Logic (SHOULD TEST)

#### **D. `upgradeToPro` - Pro Upgrade Flow**
**Why Important**: Core conversion funnel. Errors could block revenue or cause incorrect billing state.

**High-Value Test Cases**:
1. ✅ **Free user upgraded successfully** (happy path)
2. ✅ **Already-Pro user returns gracefully** (idempotency)
3. ✅ **Subscription end date set correctly** (1 year from now)
4. ✅ **Trial marked as used on upgrade** (trial state transition)

**Testing Approach**: Unit tests with mocked Firestore

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (4 test cases, simpler logic)

---

#### **E. `deleteWorkspace` - Workspace Deletion**
**Why Important**: Data deletion is high-risk. Must handle cascading deletes properly.

**High-Value Test Cases**:
1. ✅ **Admin can delete workspace** (happy path)
2. ✅ **Non-admin blocked** (authorization)
3. ✅ **All members updated** (member array cleanup)
4. ✅ **Workspace conversations deleted** (cascade delete)
5. ✅ **Notifications sent to members** (communication)

**Testing Approach**: Unit tests with batch operation mocking

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (5 test cases, batch complexity)

---

#### **F. `acceptWorkspaceInvitation` - Invitation Acceptance**
**Why Important**: Multi-step transaction, member limit enforcement.

**High-Value Test Cases**:
1. ✅ **User joins workspace successfully** (happy path)
2. ✅ **Already-member returns gracefully** (idempotency)
3. ✅ **25-member limit enforced** (capacity check)
4. ✅ **Invitation status updated atomically** (transaction consistency)
5. ✅ **Non-invitee blocked** (authorization)

**Testing Approach**: Unit tests with transaction mocking

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours (5 test cases)

---

### Priority 3: Lower-Risk Logic (NICE TO HAVE)

#### **G. `downgradeToFree`**
- Simpler inverse of upgrade
- Less critical (user-initiated)
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 hour (2-3 test cases)

#### **H. `getTrialStatus`**
- Helper function, less complex than `canAccessAIFeatures`
- Already covered implicitly in AI access tests
- **Estimated Effort**: 30 minutes (2 test cases)

---

## Testing Infrastructure Needs

### Existing Infrastructure
✅ Jest configured (`functions/jest.config.js`)
✅ Testing patterns established (`functions/src/__tests__/setup.ts`)
✅ Firestore mocking utilities (`@firebase/testing` alternative)

### New Infrastructure Needed
1. **Time-based mocking**: For spam strike decay tests
2. **Transaction mocking**: For complex multi-document updates
3. **Batch operation mocking**: For workspace deletion cascades

---

## Recommended Testing Approach

### Phase 1: Critical (Priority 1) - **MUST DO**
1. `canAccessAIFeatures` (7 tests, 2-3 hours)
2. `createWorkspace` (9 tests, 4-5 hours)
3. `reportWorkspaceInvitationSpam` (7 tests, 3-4 hours)

**Total**: 23 tests, ~10-12 hours

**ROI**: Highest. These cover core monetization, access control, and spam prevention.

---

### Phase 2: Important (Priority 2) - **SHOULD DO**
4. `upgradeToPro` (4 tests, 1-2 hours)
5. `deleteWorkspace` (5 tests, 2-3 hours)
6. `acceptWorkspaceInvitation` (5 tests, 2-3 hours)

**Total**: 14 tests, ~5-8 hours

**ROI**: High. Covers conversion funnel and data integrity.

---

### Phase 3: Nice-to-Have (Priority 3) - **OPTIONAL**
7. `downgradeToFree` (3 tests, 1 hour)
8. `getTrialStatus` (2 tests, 30 minutes)

**Total**: 5 tests, ~1.5 hours

**ROI**: Medium. Provides complete coverage but lower risk.

---

## Alternative: Integration Testing

### Manual Testing (Current Approach)
✅ Already have `scripts/testCloudFunctions.js`
✅ Already have `scripts/testTrialAndUpgrade.js`
✅ Manual testing guide in `MANUAL-TESTING-GUIDE.md`

**Pros**:
- Tests real Firestore
- Catches integration issues
- Fast to write

**Cons**:
- Slow to run
- Requires cleanup
- Not automatable in CI/CD

### Recommended: **Hybrid Approach**
1. **Unit tests** for complex logic (spam decay, AI access rules)
2. **Manual scripts** for end-to-end flows (user journeys)
3. **No integration tests** for MVP (defer to future)

---

## Risks of NOT Testing

### High Risk (Priority 1)
- **AI Access Control**: Free users get paid features → Revenue loss
- **Workspace Creation**: Spam-banned users create workspaces → Platform abuse
- **Spam System**: Decay logic broken → Innocent users banned OR spammers not banned

### Medium Risk (Priority 2)
- **Upgrade Flow**: Users blocked from converting → Revenue loss
- **Workspace Deletion**: Data not cleaned up → Database bloat, orphaned data

### Low Risk (Priority 3)
- **Downgrade**: User-initiated, reversible
- **Trial Status**: Helper function, UI-only impact

---

## Recommendation

### For MVP Launch
**Minimum**: Implement **Priority 1** tests (10-12 hours)
- Covers critical monetization and access control
- Prevents revenue loss and platform abuse

### For Production
**Recommended**: Implement **Priority 1 + 2** tests (15-20 hours total)
- Comprehensive coverage of all business-critical logic
- Ready for CI/CD integration

### Post-MVP
**Optional**: Add **Priority 3** tests (1.5 hours)
- 100% coverage for documentation purposes

## Action Items

1. ☐ Create `functions/src/__tests__/workspace.test.ts`
2. ☐ Create `functions/src/__tests__/billing.test.ts`
3. ☐ Create `functions/src/__tests__/aiAccess.test.ts`
4. ☐ Set up time-based mocking utilities
5. ☐ Set up transaction/batch mocking utilities
6. ☐ Add test commands to `functions/package.json`:
   - `npm test` (unit tests only)
   - `npm run test:manual` (run manual test scripts)
7. ☐ Update `.github/workflows` to run unit tests on PR

---

## Conclusion

**Current State**: ~700 lines of untested critical business logic

**Recommended Action**: Invest 10-12 hours to test Priority 1 functions before MVP launch

**Expected Outcome**: 
- 80% coverage of high-risk logic
- Confidence in monetization and access control
- Foundation for CI/CD pipeline

**Alternative**: Continue with manual testing only, but document risks in launch checklist.
