# Refactoring Progress Update

## âœ… Phase 1: Helper Creation (COMPLETE)
All 7 helper utilities created and tested:
- `subscriptionService.ts`
- `userPermissions.ts`
- `useModalManager.ts` (hook)
- `cloudFunctions.ts`
- `alerts.ts`
- `exportHelpers.ts`
- Extended `dateFormat.ts`

**50 new unit tests added, all passing**

## âœ… Phase 2a: Initial Application (COMPLETE)
- **profile.tsx** - Uses subscriptionService, userPermissions, Alerts
- **UpgradeToProModal.tsx** - Uses subscriptionService
- **workspaceExportService.ts** - Uses exportHelpers
- **userExportService.ts** - Uses exportHelpers

**Lines saved so far: ~265 lines**

## ðŸš§ Phase 2b: Remaining Opportunities

### High Priority (Should Do Soon)
1. **chat/[id].tsx** (20 Alert.alert calls)
   - Can't easily use useModalManager without major refactor
   - CAN replace Alert.alert with Alerts helpers
   - CAN use getUserPermissions for AI access checks
   
2. **Service Files** (~20 files with httpsCallable)
   - Replace with `callCloudFunction` wrapper
   - Consistent error handling

### Medium Priority
3. **Component Modals** (15 components, 29 Alert.alert calls)
   - EditMessageModal, GroupParticipantsModal, etc.
   - Replace Alert.alert with Alerts helpers

4. **Screen Files** (18 Alert.alert calls)
   - workspace/invitations.tsx (10 calls)
   - workspace/[id]/settings.tsx (9 calls)
   - new-chat.tsx (5 calls)
   - create-workspace.tsx (4 calls)
   - workspace/[id]/members.tsx (4 calls)

### Lower Priority
5. **useModalManager** in other screens
   - Most screens only have 1-2 modals
   - Not worth the refactor effort

## Summary
- **Total Alert.alert calls:** 82 (in 19 files)
- **Already refactored:** ~10 calls (profile.tsx)
- **Remaining:** ~72 calls

The refactor is valuable but would require significant time to complete comprehensively. The helpers are ready and working - we just need to apply them systematically.

## Recommendation
Focus on high-value, high-frequency code paths:
1. Apply Alerts helpers to chat screen (most used screen)
2. Apply cloudFunctions wrapper to service files (centralizes error handling)
3. Leave modal components for later (less critical)
