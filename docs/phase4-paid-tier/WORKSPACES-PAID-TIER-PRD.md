# MessageAI - Workspaces & Paid Tier PRD

**Status:** Planning Phase  
**Target:** Post-MVP Enhancement (Phase 4 - BONUS WORK)  
**Est. Implementation:** 3-4 weeks

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This phase will ONLY be implemented AFTER the currently-planned "final" phase (Phase 3) is complete and polished, including the brain lift and demo video. This is bonus work to be done after Phase 3.

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD introduces a **two-tier paid subscription model** and **Workspaces** - a premium feature enabling team organization, enhanced admin controls, and collaborative AI-powered features. This transforms MessageAI from a personal messaging app into a team collaboration platform.

### Product Vision

**For remote teams** who need structured collaboration with AI assistance, **MessageAI Workspaces** provides organized team spaces with admin controls, enhanced AI features, and spam protection - **unlike** basic messaging apps that lack team structure or AI capabilities.

### Revenue Model

- **Free Tier:** Basic messaging (direct + group chats) only; AI features only work in workspace chats

- **Pro Tier ($3/month):** Unlock all AI features everywhere (personal + workspace chats)
- **Workspace Tier ($0.50/user/month):** Create workspaces with admin controls and collaborative tools
  - Admin pre-selects max users (2-25) and pays for all seats
  - Example: Workspace with 10 members (admin's choice) → Admin pays $5/month
  - Billed monthly on 1st of month; pro-rated for signup/expansions
  - **Requires Pro subscription** ($3/month base fee required)

### Key Value Propositions

---

## 2. Pricing & Billing

### 2.1 Tier Breakdown

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Basic messaging, AI in workspaces only |
| **Pro** | $3/month | All AI features everywhere |
| **Workspace** | +$0.50/user/month | Admin controls, team collaboration (per workspace) |

### 2.2 Billing Rules

**Base Pro Subscription ($3/month):**

- Required to create workspaces
- Enables all AI features in personal chats
- Billed monthly on 1st of month
- Pro-rated at signup (see examples below)

**Workspace Charges ($0.50/user/month per workspace):**

- **Pre-selected capacity model:** Admin chooses max users (2-25) upfront and pays for all seats
- **Example Scenarios:**
  - Admin creates workspace with 10-seat capacity → Pays $5/month (even if only 5 members join)
  - Admin wants to expand to 15 seats mid-month → Prompted to upgrade, pays pro-rated amount
  - Billing: $5 (original) + ($2.50 × days_remaining / days_in_month)
  - Admin wants to downgrade to 8 seats → Must first remove members to fit new capacity
  
**UI Guidance:**
- During workspace creation: "You're selecting capacity for [10] members. You'll pay for all seats even if not filled. You can expand later if needed."
- Expansion prompt: "Expand workspace from 10 to 15 members? Additional charge: $X.XX (pro-rated for this month)"
- Downgrade flow: "You have 10 members but want 8 seats. Remove 2 members first, then downgrade capacity."
  
**Pro-Rated Billing Examples:**

**Scenario 1: New Pro signup mid-month**

- User signs up June 15th (halfway through month)
- June charge: $3 × 0.5 = **$1.50**
- July 1st charge: **$3** (full month)

**Scenario 2: New workspace creation mid-month**

- Pro user creates workspace June 15th with 10 members
- June charge: $5 × 0.5 = **$2.50**
- July 1st charge: **$5** (full month for 10 members)

**Scenario 3: Workspace expansion mid-month**

- June 1st: Workspace with 10 members → Pays $5
- June 15th: Admin wants to add 5 more (total 15)
- Immediate charge: 5 members × $0.50 × 0.5 month = **$1.25**
- July 1st charge: **$7.50** (full month for 15 members)

**Tracking Requirements:**

- Track `maxUsersThisMonth` per workspace (admin's chosen capacity)
- Reset on 1st of month
- When admin expands: calculate pro-rated charge, process payment, then increment limit
- When admin downgrades: verify actual members <= new capacity, downgrade takes effect NEXT billing cycle (no pro-rated refunds)

**Billing Start Timing:**

- Workspace created on 1st of month → No pro-rated charge, first bill on 1st of next month
- Workspace created mid-month (e.g., Jan 15th) → Pro-rated charge for remainder of January (Jan 15-31), then full month bill on Feb 1st
- Formula: `seatsAdded × $0.50 × (daysRemaining / daysInMonth)`

### 2.3 Payment Enforcement

**MVP Upgrade Flow (No Real Payment):**

- User clicks "Upgrade to Pro" → Instant upgrade (no payment required in MVP)
- Firestore: Set `isPaidUser: true`, `trialEndsAt: null` (no longer in trial)
- Success message: "✅ Upgrade successful! AI features unlocked. Note: After the MVP period, real payment will be required."
- No payment capture, instant access

**5-Day Free Trial Flow:**

- New user signs up → Firestore: `trialStartedAt: serverTimestamp()`, `trialEndsAt: now + 5 days`
- During trial: User has full Pro access (all AI features everywhere)
- Trial expiring: Notification on Day 3, Day 4, Day 5 morning
- Trial expired: AI features locked to workspace chats only, upgrade prompt shown
- Check: `now > trialEndsAt && !isPaidUser` → Show trial expired UI

**500 User MVP Limit:**

- Registration flow checks total users in Firestore
- If `users.length >= 500` → Block signup
- Error message: "Sorry: in MVP mode, max users reached. Please check back later."
- Check happens before account creation
- Existing 4 test users count toward limit

**Future: Real Payment Flow (Post-MVP):**

- Integrate Stripe (see Section 12)
- Capture payment before upgrade
- Monthly recurring billing

**Subscription Lapse:**

- **Payment fails:** Workspace becomes **read-only immediately**
  - Members can view messages
  - Cannot send messages or create chats
  - AI features disabled (even for Pro members in that workspace)
- **No deletion:** Workspace remains read-only indefinitely (no 30-day deletion)
- **Notification:** Push + in-app notification when payment fails
- **Restoration:** Once payment succeeds, workspace becomes active again

**Workspace Limit Enforcement:**

- Max 5 active workspaces per user
- Deleting workspace decrements count (can create new one)
- Creating 6th workspace → "Workspace limit reached (5 max)" error

---

## 3. Workspaces

### 3.1 Core Concept

A **Workspace** is an isolated team environment with:

- Single admin (creator, must be Pro user)
- Admin pre-selects max users (2-25) and pays $0.50/seat/month
- Up to 25 members (free or paid users - admin pays for all)
- Group chats (workspace-specific)
- Direct chats (workspace-specific, accessible only while in workspace)
- Admin controls for collaboration
- **Key benefit for free users:** AI features work in workspace chats!

### 3.2 Workspace Lifecycle

**Creation:**

1. Pro user clicks "Create Workspace"
2. Enter workspace name
3. Optionally add members immediately
4. Workspace created, user becomes admin
5. Billing starts: $1 × initial member count (next month)

**Invitation:**

1. Admin adds members by email/username
2. Member receives:
   - Push notification
   - In-app notification in "Workspaces" section
3. Member can: **Accept**, **Decline**, or **Report as Spam**
4. If accepted: Member added to workspace, gains access to all group chats
5. If declined: Invitation deleted, no further action
6. If spam: Admin's global spam counter incremented

**Member Management:**

1. **Admin removes member:**
   - Member loses access to all workspace chats (group + direct)
   - Member removed from workspace member list
   - Direct chats with that member persist for admin/other members only
   - **Notification:** Member receives push + in-app notification: "You were removed from [Workspace Name]"
2. **Member leaves voluntarily:**
   - Same as admin removal (access loss)
   - Member can rejoin if re-invited
   - No notification needed (user-initiated action)

**Deletion:**

1. **Admin deletes workspace (immediate, no grace period):**
   - Confirmation modal shows: "⚠️ This will permanently delete: X group chats (Y messages), Z direct chats (N messages), all action items and AI history. This CANNOT be undone."
   - User confirms → Immediate deletion
   - All group chats deleted
   - All direct chats deleted
   - All members lose access
   - Workspace count decrements (admin can create another)
   - **Notification:** All members receive push + in-app notification: "[Workspace Name] was deleted by admin"
2. **Admin account deleted:**
   - Same as workspace deletion
   - All workspaces owned by admin deleted
   - **Notification:** All members receive: "[Workspace Name] was deleted (admin account removed)"

**Notification Management:**

- Workspace notifications stored in `/users/{uid}/notifications` with `type: 'workspace'`
- Notifications include: `workspaceId`, `action` (added/removed/deleted), `timestamp`
- Once user views notification → marked as read, deleted after 24 hours
- Badge count on "Workspaces" tab reflects unread workspace notifications

### 3.3 Workspace Constraints

- **Max 25 members** per workspace (at any given time, no historical tracking)
- **Max 5 workspaces** per user (admin)
- **One admin per workspace** (no co-admins, no ownership transfer)
- **Workspace names** must be unique per user for better UX (prevents confusion in dropdowns)
- **Validation:** If user tries to create workspace with existing name → Error: "Choose unique name (You already have a workspace with that name)"
- Workspaces stored in top-level collection: `/workspaces/{workspaceId}` (user document tracks owned workspace IDs via `workspacesOwned` array)

**Enterprise Inquiry:**

- When attempting to add 26th member to workspace or group chat:
  - Pop-up modal: "Limit reached. Teams larger than 25 members require our Enterprise plan. [Contact Sales]"
  - Error: "Limit reached: 25 members max. For enterprise teams, [inquire here](https://x.com/adam__isom)"
  - "Inquire here" is a clickable link to: `https://x.com/adam__isom`

### 3.4 Chat Organization in Workspaces

**Group Chats:**

- Created by admin within workspace
- All workspace members auto-added
- Max 25 members (same as workspace limit)
- Deleted when workspace deleted
- Cannot be moved to another workspace

**Direct Chats:**

- Any workspace member can start with another workspace member
- Only visible to the two participants
- Tied to workspace (deleted when workspace deleted)
- **Access rules when member leaves/removed/workspace deleted:**
  - Member immediately loses access to ALL workspace direct chats (hard delete from their conversation list)
  - Cannot view or send messages (security rules prevent access)
  - Chat remains in Firestore for other participant (if still in workspace)
  - If accessed via cached deep link → "You no longer have access to this chat"

**Non-Workspace Chats:**

- Regular direct chats and group chats (outside workspaces)
- Available to all users (free + paid)
- No admin controls
- No AI features for free users (upgrade prompt shown)
- AI features work for paid users

## 4. AI Feature Access Control

### 4.1 Feature Availability Matrix

| Feature | Free User (Personal) | Free User (Workspace) | Pro User | Admin (Workspace) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Thread Summary** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ + Edit/Save |
| **Action Items** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ (view only) | ✅ (view only) | ✅ + Assign + Edit/Save |
| **Smart Search** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Priority Detection** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Decision Tracking** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ + Edit/Save |
| **Meeting Scheduler** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **My Tasks** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Access Rule:**

- AI features work for Pro users everywhere
- AI features work for free users ONLY in workspace chats
- Action assignment, editing, saving = Admin-only in workspaces

### 4.2 Feature Gating Implementation

**Client-Side Check (React Native):**

```typescript
function canAccessAIFeatures(user: User, conversation: Conversation): boolean {
  // Pro users can access AI everywhere
  if (user.isPaidUser) return true;
  
  // Users in 5-day trial get full Pro access
  if (user.trialEndsAt && Date.now() < user.trialEndsAt.toMillis()) {
    return true; // Trial active
  }
  
  // Free users (after trial) can only access AI in workspace chats
  if (conversation.workspaceId) {
    return isUserInWorkspace(user.uid, conversation.workspaceId);
  }
  
  // Free users outside workspaces: no AI (show upgrade prompt)
  return false;
}
```

**UI Behavior:**

- **Users in 5-day trial:** All AI features work everywhere (like Pro users)
- **Trial expiring:** Banner shown on Day 3-5: "Your trial ends in X days. Upgrade to keep AI in personal chats."
- **Free users (post-trial) in personal chats:** Sparkle menu (✨) visible but tapping features shows "Upgrade to Pro" modal
- **Free users (post-trial) in workspace chats:** All AI features work normally (view-only, no admin features)
- **Pro users:** All AI features work everywhere

**Cloud Function Validation:**

- All AI Cloud Functions must check `isPaidUser` OR workspace membership
- Reject with `permission-denied` if not authorized

---

## 5. Admin-Only Features

### 5.1 Action Item Assignment

**Current Behavior:**

- AI extracts action items with optional assignee detection
- Items displayed in read-only modal

**New Behavior (Workspace Admins Only):**

- Admin can manually assign unassigned items to workspace members
- Admin can reassign items to different members
- Members see "Assigned to you" indicator
- Assignments persist across devices

**Implementation:**

- Add "Assign" button for admin users only
- Picker shows workspace members
- Update Firestore: `assigneeUid`, `assigneeDisplayName`
- Real-time sync via Firestore listeners

### 5.2 My Tasks View

**Feature Overview:**

- Aggregated view of all action items assigned to the current user
- Separate views for workspace vs. non-workspace tasks
- Available to Pro users only (AI feature)

**Implementation:**

**In Workspace Mode:**

- Small "My Tasks" button visible (e.g., in workspace navigation)
- Shows all action items assigned to user in CURRENT workspace only
- Query: `conversations/{id}/ai_action_items where assigneeUid == currentUser && conversationWorkspaceId == currentWorkspaceId`

**In Regular Chat Mode (Non-Workspace):**

- "My Tasks" button in main navigation
- Shows all action items assigned to user in NON-workspace chats only
- Query: `conversations/{id}/ai_action_items where assigneeUid == currentUser && conversationWorkspaceId == null`

**Task List UI:**

```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│  My Tasks (Project Team)          │
│                                   │
│  ✓ Review Q4 budget               │
│    From: Budget Planning          │
│    Assigned: Oct 25               │
│                                   │
│  ○ Schedule team meeting          │
│    From: Operations Team          │
│    Assigned: Oct 24               │
│                                   │
│  [No tasks yet]                   │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Interaction:**

- Tapping task → Opens conversation where it was assigned
- Long press → Mark as complete (future enhancement)

### 5.3 Edit & Save AI Content

**Applies To:**

- Thread summaries
- Decision records
- Action items list

**Workflow:**

1. Admin opens AI feature (e.g., "Thread Summary")
2. AI generates content (cached)
3. Admin sees "Edit & Save" button (admin only)
4. Clicks button → Modal opens with editable fields
5. Admin edits content
6. Clicks "Save" → Replaces AI-generated version
7. New version stored as "saved" (flagged `editedByAdmin: true`)
8. All members see edited version going forward

**Storage:**

- **Single saved version** per feature per workspace-group-chat
- Overwrites previous saved version (no history)
- Original AI-generated version NOT preserved (replaced entirely)
- Saved version marked `savedByAdmin: uid`, `savedAt: timestamp`, `editedByAdmin: true`

**UI States:**

- **No saved version:** Display AI-generated content with "Edit & Save" button (admin only)
- **Saved version exists:** Display saved content with "✏️ Edited" badge + "Re-edit" button (admin only)
- **Admin view:** "Edit" button to modify saved version

---

## 6. Spam Prevention

### 6.1 Strike System

**Goal:** Prevent spam invitations to workspaces and group chats.

**Mechanics:**

- Global counter: `spamStrikes` (stored in `/users/{uid}`)
- Max strikes: **5**
- Strike triggers:
  1. User invited to workspace → marks as spam
  2. User added to group chat → marks as spam
- **Decay system:** Strikes older than 1 month are automatically removed
  - Tracked with timestamps in `spamReportsReceived` array
  - Checked/cleaned during:
    - Spam report submission
    - User attempts to invite someone to workspace/group chat
- No appeals process

**Penalties:**

- **5 strikes reached:**
  - ❌ Cannot create workspaces
  - ❌ Cannot create group chats
  - ✅ Can still create direct chats
  - ✅ Can still be invited to workspaces/group chats
  - 🔔 User notified via push notification + email

**Report Flow:**

1. User receives workspace/group chat invitation
2. In-app notification shows:
   - "Alice invited you to 'Marketing Team' workspace"
   - Buttons: **Accept** | **Decline** | **Report Spam**
3. User clicks "Report Spam"
4. Confirmation: "Report this invitation as spam?"
5. Confirmed → Inviter's `spamStrikes` incremented
6. Invitation declined automatically

**Important:** Users can ONLY report spam at the invitation stage (before accepting). Once they join a workspace or group chat, the "Report Spam" option is no longer available. They can leave at any time, but leaving does not count as spam reporting.

**Tracking:**

```typescript
// Firestore: /users/{uid}
{
  spamStrikes: 3, // Computed field (count of non-expired strikes)
  spamReportsReceived: [
    { reportedBy: 'user123', reason: 'workspace', timestamp, workspaceId },
    { reportedBy: 'user456', reason: 'groupChat', timestamp, conversationId },
    { reportedBy: 'user789', reason: 'workspace', timestamp, workspaceId }
  ],
  spamBanned: false // Set to true when active strikes >= 5
}
```

**Decay Logic:**

```typescript
// When checking strikes, filter out strikes older than 1 month
function getActiveStrikes(user: User): number {
  const oneMonthAgo = Date.now() - (30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  const activeReports = user.spamReportsReceived.filter(
    report => report.timestamp.toMillis() > oneMonthAgo
  );
  return activeReports.length;
}

// Update spamStrikes and spamBanned based on active count
// Clean old reports from array periodically
```

### 6.2 Prevention Measures

- **Rate limiting:** Max 20 invitations per day per user
- **Verification:** Email verification required to create workspaces
- **Warning system:** 
  - Notification at 3 active strikes: "⚠️ You have 3 spam reports. Be careful - 5 strikes will restrict workspace/group creation."
  - Notification at 4 active strikes: "⚠️ You have 4 spam reports. One more will restrict your account."
  - Notification at 5 strikes: "🚫 Your account is restricted from creating workspaces and group chats due to spam reports."
- **Decay notification:** When a strike expires: "✅ A spam strike from 30+ days ago has been removed. You now have X active strikes."

```

### 10.2 Cloud Function Authorization

All AI Cloud Functions must validate:

```typescript
// Example: extractActionItems function
export const extractActionItems = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // 1. Auth check
  if (!context.auth) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'Must be authenticated');
  }
  
  // 2. Get conversation
  const conversation = await getConversation(data.conversationId);
  
  // 3. Verify user is participant
  if (!conversation.participants.includes(context.auth.uid)) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('permission-denied', 'Not a participant');
  }
  
  // 4. Check AI feature access
  const user = await getUser(context.auth.uid);
  
  // Pro users can access AI everywhere
  if (user.isPaidUser) {
    // Proceed with AI extraction...
    return;
  }
  
  // Free users can only access AI in workspace chats
  if (conversation.workspaceId) {
    const workspace = await getWorkspace(conversation.workspaceId);
    if (workspace.members.includes(context.auth.uid)) {
      // Free user in workspace chat: allowed
      // Proceed with AI extraction...
      return;
    }
  }
  
  // Free user in personal chat: denied
  throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
    'permission-denied',
    'AI features require Pro subscription ($3/month) or workspace membership'
  );
});
```

3. Add strike limit enforcement (5 strikes)
4. Add notification on ban
5. Block workspace/group chat creation for banned users

**Testing:**

## 12. Future Enhancements

> **Note:** This section documents features that are out of scope for the initial Phase 4 implementation but may be valuable in future iterations.

### 12.0 Deferred Features from Phase 4

**Direct Chat Export on Workspace Deletion:**
- Currently: Workspace direct chats are deleted when workspace is deleted
- Future: Allow members to request email export of their direct chat history before deletion
- Implementation: Admin triggers deletion → System emails each member a PDF/JSON export of their direct chats → Wait 7 days → Delete workspace

**AI Content Edit History:**
- Currently: Admins can edit/save AI content, but only latest version is preserved (no history)
- Future: Keep version history for transparency and undo capability
- Implementation: Store edit history array with timestamps, editor UIDs, and previous versions
- UI: "View History" button shows changelog, "Revert to Version X" option

**Enhanced Enterprise Sales Funnel:**
- Currently: 25-member limit shows link to Twitter DM
- Future: Dedicated enterprise inquiry form with:
  - Team size input
  - Use case description
  - Contact information
  - Custom pricing calculator
  - Auto-email to sales team
  - CRM integration (HubSpot, Salesforce)

**Trial Extensions:**
- Currently: Hard 5-day trial, then AI locks to workspace chats only
- Future: Allow one 3-day extension if user is "close to converting" (e.g., used AI 10+ times)
- Future: Referral bonuses (invite 3 friends, get 1 month free Pro)

**Workspace Capacity Recommendations:**
- Currently: Basic UI guidance during workspace creation
- Future: Smart capacity recommendations based on:
  - User's email domain (fetch company size from Clearbit/LinkedIn)
  - Average group chat size
  - "Most teams your size choose 10-15 members"

**Spam Strike Appeals:**
- Currently: No appeals process, 1-month decay only
- Future: "Request Review" button for users who feel unfairly flagged
- Manual review by support team
- Evidence submission (screenshots, context)



### 12.1 Payment Integration (Stripe)

**Setup:**

1. Install Stripe SDK: `npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-react-native`
2. Create Stripe account, get API keys
3. Set up products:
   - Pro Plan: $3/month recurring
   - Workspace Add-On: $0.50/user/month metered billing

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Cloud Function: createCheckoutSession
export const createCheckoutSession = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
  
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    customer: context.auth.uid,
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [{
      price: 'price_pro_monthly', // $3/month
      quantity: 1,
    }],
    mode: 'subscription',
    success_url: 'messageai://payment/success',
    cancel_url: 'messageai://payment/cancel',
  });
  
  return { sessionId: session.id };
});

// Cloud Function: handleWorkspaceBilling (runs monthly)
export const handleWorkspaceBilling = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('0 0 1 * *') // First day of month
  .onRun(async () => {
    const workspaces = await db.collection('workspaces').get();
    
    for (const workspace of workspaces.docs) {
      const data = workspace.data();
      const charge = data.maxUsersThisMonth * 0.50; // $0.50 per user
      
      await stripe.invoiceItems.create({
        customer: data.adminStripeId,
        amount: charge * 100, // Cents
        currency: 'usd',
        description: `Workspace: ${data.name} (${data.maxUsersThisMonth} users)`
      });
      
      // Reset counter for new month
      await workspace.ref.update({ maxUsersThisMonth: data.members.length });
    }
  });
```

**Webhooks:**

- `payment_intent.succeeded` → Set `isPaidUser: true`
- `payment_intent.failed` → Set workspace read-only
- `customer.subscription.deleted` → Cancel subscription, schedule deletion

## 14. Open Questions & Decisions

### Decisions Made

✅ **Pricing:** $3/month Pro + $0.50/user/month Workspace  
✅ **AI Access:** Pro users everywhere, free users ONLY in workspace chats (sales funnel)  
✅ **Admin pre-selects workspace capacity** (2-25 members, pays for all seats)  
✅ **Pro-rated billing** for mid-month signups and expansions  
✅ **MVP:** Instant free upgrades (no real payment), 500 user limit on signup  
✅ **One admin per workspace** (no transfer, no co-admins)  
✅ **5 workspace limit per user** (decrements on deletion)  
✅ **25 member limit** per workspace/group (enterprise link: <https://x.com/adam__isom>)  
✅ **Spam strikes: 5** (permanent, global, disables workspace/group creation)  
✅ **Spam reports:** Only at invitation stage (not after joining)  
✅ **Payment lapse:** Read-only → 30-day deletion  
✅ **Direct chat access:** Lost when member leaves/removed/workspace deleted  
✅ **Edit AI content:** No original preservation (single saved version only)  
✅ **My Tasks:** Per-workspace + non-workspace views (Pro users only)  
✅ **Workspace names:** Must be unique per user  
✅ **Workspace notifications:** Push + in-app, deleted after 24h when read  
✅ **Billing cycle:** 1st of month for everyone  
✅ **Billing start timing:** Pro-rated from creation date (unless created on 1st)  
✅ **Downgrades:** Take effect next billing cycle (no pro-rated refunds)  
✅ **Direct chat removal:** Hard delete from conversation list (security rules prevent access)  
✅ **Trial limitations:** Cannot create workspaces during trial (Pro subscription required)

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should we offer annual plans (discount)?
- [ ] Should workspace admins see member activity stats?
- [ ] Should we allow workspace name changes?
- [ ] Should we add workspace icons/branding?
- [ ] Should workspace direct chats have separate notification settings?
