---

## 2. Pricing & Billing

### 2.1 Tier Breakdown

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 | Basic messaging, AI in workspaces only |
| **Pro** | $3/month | All AI features everywhere |
| **Workspace** | +$0.50/user/month | Admin controls, team collaboration (per workspace) |

### 2.2 Billing Rules

**Base Pro Subscription ($3/month):**

- Required to create workspaces
- Enables all AI features in personal chats
- Billed monthly on 1st of month
- Pro-rated at signup (see examples below)

**Workspace Charges ($0.50/user/month per workspace):**

- **Pre-selected capacity model:** Admin chooses max users (2-25) upfront and pays for all seats
- **Example Scenarios:**
  - Admin creates workspace with 10-seat capacity → Pays $5/month (even if only 5 members join)
  - Admin wants to expand to 15 seats mid-month → Prompted to upgrade, pays pro-rated amount
  - Billing: $5 (original) + ($2.50 × days_remaining / days_in_month)
  - Admin wants to downgrade to 8 seats → Must first remove members to fit new capacity
  
**UI Guidance:**

- During workspace creation: "You're selecting capacity for [10] members. You'll pay for all seats even if not filled. You can expand later if needed."
- Expansion prompt: "Expand workspace from 10 to 15 members? Additional charge: $X.XX (pro-rated for this month)"
- Downgrade flow: "You have 10 members but want 8 seats. Remove 2 members first, then downgrade capacity."
  
**Pro-Rated Billing Examples:**

**Scenario 1: New Pro signup mid-month**

- User signs up June 15th (halfway through month)
- June charge: $3 × 0.5 = **$1.50**
- July 1st charge: **$3** (full month)

**Scenario 2: New workspace creation mid-month**

- Pro user creates workspace June 15th with 10 members
- June charge: $5 × 0.5 = **$2.50**
- July 1st charge: **$5** (full month for 10 members)

**Scenario 3: Workspace expansion mid-month**

- June 1st: Workspace with 10 members → Pays $5
- June 15th: Admin wants to add 5 more (total 15)
- Immediate charge: 5 members × $0.50 × 0.5 month = **$1.25**
- July 1st charge: **$7.50** (full month for 15 members)

**Tracking Requirements:**

- Track `maxUsersThisMonth` per workspace (admin's chosen capacity)
- Reset on 1st of month
- When admin expands: calculate pro-rated charge, process payment, then increment limit
- When admin downgrades: verify actual members <= new capacity, downgrade takes effect NEXT billing cycle (no pro-rated refunds)

**Billing Start Timing:**

- Workspace created on 1st of month → No pro-rated charge, first bill on 1st of next month
- Workspace created mid-month (e.g., Jan 15th) → Pro-rated charge for remainder of January (Jan 15-31), then full month bill on Feb 1st
- Formula: `seatsAdded × $0.50 × (daysRemaining / daysInMonth)`

### 2.3 Payment Enforcement

**MVP Upgrade Flow (No Real Payment):**

- User clicks "Upgrade to Pro" → Instant upgrade (no payment required in MVP)
- Firestore: Set `isPaidUser: true`, `trialEndsAt: null` (no longer in trial)
- Success message: "✅ Upgrade successful! AI features unlocked. Note: After the MVP period, real payment will be required."
- No payment capture, instant access

**5-Day Free Trial Flow:**

- New user signs up → Firestore: `trialStartedAt: serverTimestamp()`, `trialEndsAt: now + 5 days`
- During trial: User has full Pro access (all AI features everywhere)
- Trial expiring: Notification on Day 3, Day 4, Day 5 morning
- Trial expired: AI features locked to workspace chats only, upgrade prompt shown
- Check: `now > trialEndsAt && !isPaidUser` → Show trial expired UI

**500 User MVP Limit:**

- Registration flow checks total users in Firestore
- If `users.length >= 500` → Block signup
- Error message: "Sorry: in MVP mode, max users reached. Please check back later."
- Check happens before account creation
- Existing 4 test users count toward limit

**Future: Real Payment Flow (Post-MVP):**

- Integrate Stripe (see Section 12)
- Capture payment before upgrade
- Monthly recurring billing

**Subscription Lapse:**

- **Payment fails:** Workspace becomes **read-only immediately**
  - Members can view messages
  - Cannot send messages or create chats
  - AI features disabled (even for Pro members in that workspace)
- **No deletion:** Workspace remains read-only indefinitely (no 30-day deletion)
- **Notification:** Push + in-app notification when payment fails
- **Restoration:** Once payment succeeds, workspace becomes active again

**Workspace Limit Enforcement:**

- Max 5 active workspaces per user
- Deleting workspace decrements count (can create new one)
- Creating 6th workspace → "Workspace limit reached (5 max)" error

---

## 3. Workspaces

### 3.1 Core Concept

A **Workspace** is an isolated team environment with:

- Single admin (creator, must be Pro user)
- Admin pre-selects max users (2-25) and pays $0.50/seat/month
- Up to 25 members (free or paid users - admin pays for all)
- Group chats (workspace-specific)
- Direct chats (workspace-specific, accessible only while in workspace)
- Admin controls for collaboration
- **Key benefit for free users:** AI features work in workspace chats!

### 3.2 Workspace Lifecycle

**Creation:**

1. Pro user clicks "Create Workspace"
2. Enter workspace name
3. Optionally add members immediately
4. Workspace created, user becomes admin
5. Billing starts: $1 × initial member count (next month)

**Invitation:**

1. Admin adds members by email/username
2. Member receives:
   - Push notification
   - In-app notification in "Workspaces" section
3. Member can: **Accept**, **Decline**, or **Report as Spam**
4. If accepted: Member added to workspace, gains access to all group chats
5. If declined: Invitation deleted, no further action
6. If spam: Admin's global spam counter incremented

**Member Management:**

1. **Admin removes member:**
   - Member loses access to all workspace chats (group + direct)
   - Member removed from workspace member list
   - Direct chats with that member persist for admin/other members only
   - **Notification:** Member receives push + in-app notification: "You were removed from [Workspace Name]"
2. **Member leaves voluntarily:**
   - Same as admin removal (access loss)
   - Member can rejoin if re-invited
   - No notification needed (user-initiated action)

**Deletion:**

1. **Admin deletes workspace (immediate, no grace period):**
   - Confirmation modal shows: "⚠️ This will permanently delete: X group chats (Y messages), Z direct chats (N messages), all action items and AI history. This CANNOT be undone."
   - User confirms → Immediate deletion
   - All group chats deleted
   - All direct chats deleted
   - All members lose access
   - Workspace count decrements (admin can create another)
   - **Notification:** All members receive push + in-app notification: "[Workspace Name] was deleted by admin"
2. **Admin account deleted:**
   - Same as workspace deletion
   - All workspaces owned by admin deleted
   - **Notification:** All members receive: "[Workspace Name] was deleted (admin account removed)"

**Notification Management:**

- Workspace notifications stored in `/users/{uid}/notifications` with `type: 'workspace'`
- Notifications include: `workspaceId`, `action` (added/removed/deleted), `timestamp`
- Once user views notification → marked as read, deleted after 24 hours
- Badge count on "Workspaces" tab reflects unread workspace notifications

### 3.3 Workspace Constraints

- **Max 25 members** per workspace (at any given time, no historical tracking)
- **Max 5 workspaces** per user (admin)
- **One admin per workspace** (no co-admins, no ownership transfer)
- **Workspace names** must be unique per user for better UX (prevents confusion in dropdowns)
- **Validation:** If user tries to create workspace with existing name → Error: "Choose unique name (You already have a workspace with that name)"
- Workspaces stored in top-level collection: `/workspaces/{workspaceId}` (user document tracks owned workspace IDs via `workspacesOwned` array)

**Enterprise Inquiry:**

- When attempting to add 26th member to workspace or group chat:
  - Pop-up modal: "Limit reached. Teams larger than 25 members require our Enterprise plan. [Contact Sales]"
  - Error: "Limit reached: 25 members max. For enterprise teams, [inquire here](https://x.com/adam__isom)"
  - "Inquire here" is a clickable link to: `https://x.com/adam__isom`

### 3.4 Chat Organization in Workspaces

**Group Chats:**

- Created by admin within workspace
- All workspace members auto-added
- Max 25 members (same as workspace limit)
- Deleted when workspace deleted
- Cannot be moved to another workspace

**Direct Chats:**

- Any workspace member can start with another workspace member
- Only visible to the two participants
- Tied to workspace (deleted when workspace deleted)
- **Access rules when member leaves/removed/workspace deleted:**
  - Member immediately loses access to ALL workspace direct chats (hard delete from their conversation list)
  - Cannot view or send messages (security rules prevent access)
  - Chat remains in Firestore for other participant (if still in workspace)
  - If accessed via cached deep link → "You no longer have access to this chat"

**Non-Workspace Chats:**

- Regular direct chats and group chats (outside workspaces)
- Available to all users (free + paid)
- No admin controls
- No AI features for free users (upgrade prompt shown)
- AI features work for paid users

## 4. AI Feature Access Control

### 4.1 Feature Availability Matrix

| Feature | Free User (Personal) | Free User (Workspace) | Pro User | Admin (Workspace) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Thread Summary** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ + Edit/Save |
| **Action Items** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ (view only) | ✅ (view only) | ✅ + Assign + Edit/Save |
| **Smart Search** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Priority Detection** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Decision Tracking** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ + Edit/Save |
| **Meeting Scheduler** | ❌ Upgrade prompt | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **My Tasks** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Access Rule:**

- AI features work for Pro users everywhere
- AI features work for free users ONLY in workspace chats
- Action assignment, editing, saving = Admin-only in workspaces

### 4.2 Feature Gating Implementation

**Client-Side Check (React Native):**

```typescript
function canAccessAIFeatures(user: User, conversation: Conversation): boolean {
  // Pro users can access AI everywhere
  if (user.isPaidUser) return true;
  
  // Users in 5-day trial get full Pro access
  if (user.trialEndsAt && Date.now() < user.trialEndsAt.toMillis()) {
    return true; // Trial active
  }
  
  // Free users (after trial) can only access AI in workspace chats
  if (conversation.workspaceId) {
    return isUserInWorkspace(user.uid, conversation.workspaceId);
  }
  
  // Free users outside workspaces: no AI (show upgrade prompt)
  return false;
}
```

**UI Behavior:**

- **Users in 5-day trial:** All AI features work everywhere (like Pro users)
- **Trial expiring:** Banner shown on Day 3-5: "Your trial ends in X days. Upgrade to keep AI in personal chats."
- **Free users (post-trial) in personal chats:** Sparkle menu (✨) visible but tapping features shows "Upgrade to Pro" modal
- **Free users (post-trial) in workspace chats:** All AI features work normally (view-only, no admin features)
- **Pro users:** All AI features work everywhere

**Cloud Function Validation:**

- All AI Cloud Functions must check `isPaidUser` OR workspace membership
- Reject with `permission-denied` if not authorized

---

## 5. Admin-Only Features

### 5.1 Action Item Assignment

**Current Behavior:**

- AI extracts action items with optional assignee detection
- Items displayed in read-only modal

**New Behavior (Workspace Admins Only):**

- Admin can manually assign unassigned items to workspace members
- Admin can reassign items to different members
- Members see "Assigned to you" indicator
- Assignments persist across devices

**Implementation:**

- Add "Assign" button for admin users only
- Picker shows workspace members
- Update Firestore: `assigneeUid`, `assigneeDisplayName`
- Real-time sync via Firestore listeners

### 5.2 My Tasks View

**Feature Overview:**

- Aggregated view of all action items assigned to the current user
- Separate views for workspace vs. non-workspace tasks
- Available to Pro users only (AI feature)

**Implementation:**

**In Workspace Mode:**

- Small "My Tasks" button visible (e.g., in workspace navigation)
- Shows all action items assigned to user in CURRENT workspace only
- Query: `conversations/{id}/ai_action_items where assigneeUid == currentUser && conversationWorkspaceId == currentWorkspaceId`

**In Regular Chat Mode (Non-Workspace):**

- "My Tasks" button in main navigation
- Shows all action items assigned to user in NON-workspace chats only
- Query: `conversations/{id}/ai_action_items where assigneeUid == currentUser && conversationWorkspaceId == null`

**Task List UI:**

```
┌───────────────────────────────────┐
│  My Tasks (Project Team)          │
│                                   │
│  ✓ Review Q4 budget               │
│    From: Budget Planning          │
│    Assigned: Oct 25               │
│                                   │
│  ○ Schedule team meeting          │
│    From: Operations Team          │
│    Assigned: Oct 24               │
│                                   │
│  [No tasks yet]                   │
└───────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Interaction:**

- Tapping task → Opens conversation where it was assigned
- Long press → Mark as complete (future enhancement)

### 5.3 Edit & Save AI Content

**Applies To:**

- Thread summaries
- Decision records
- Action items list

**Workflow:**

1. Admin opens AI feature (e.g., "Thread Summary")
2. AI generates content (cached)
3. Admin sees "Edit & Save" button (admin only)
4. Clicks button → Modal opens with editable fields
5. Admin edits content
6. Clicks "Save" → Replaces AI-generated version
7. New version stored as "saved" (flagged `editedByAdmin: true`)
8. All members see edited version going forward

**Storage:**

- **Single saved version** per feature per workspace-group-chat
- Overwrites previous saved version (no history)
- Original AI-generated version NOT preserved (replaced entirely)
- Saved version marked `savedByAdmin: uid`, `savedAt: timestamp`, `editedByAdmin: true`

**UI States:**

- **No saved version:** Display AI-generated content with "Edit & Save" button (admin only)
- **Saved version exists:** Display saved content with "✏️ Edited" badge + "Re-edit" button (admin only)
- **Admin view:** "Edit" button to modify saved version

---

## 6. Spam Prevention

### 6.1 Strike System

**Goal:** Prevent spam invitations to workspaces and group chats.

**Mechanics:**

- Global counter: `spamStrikes` (stored in `/users/{uid}`)
- Max strikes: **5**
- Strike triggers:
  1. User invited to workspace → marks as spam
  2. User added to group chat → marks as spam
- **Decay system:** Strikes older than 1 month are automatically removed
  - Tracked with timestamps in `spamReportsReceived` array
  - Checked/cleaned during:
    - Spam report submission
    - User attempts to invite someone to workspace/group chat
- No appeals process

**Penalties:**

- **5 strikes reached:**
  - ❌ Cannot create workspaces
  - ❌ Cannot create group chats
  - ✅ Can still create direct chats
  - ✅ Can still be invited to workspaces/group chats
  - 🔔 User notified via push notification + email

**Report Flow:**

1. User receives workspace/group chat invitation
2. In-app notification shows:
   - "Alice invited you to 'Marketing Team' workspace"
   - Buttons: **Accept** | **Decline** | **Report Spam**
3. User clicks "Report Spam"
4. Confirmation: "Report this invitation as spam?"
5. Confirmed → Inviter's `spamStrikes` incremented
6. Invitation declined automatically

**Important:** Users can ONLY report spam at the invitation stage (before accepting). Once they join a workspace or group chat, the "Report Spam" option is no longer available. They can leave at any time, but leaving does not count as spam reporting.

**Tracking:**

```typescript
// Firestore: /users/{uid}
{
  spamStrikes: 3, // Computed field (count of non-expired strikes)
  spamReportsReceived: [
    { reportedBy: 'user123', reason: 'workspace', timestamp, workspaceId },
    { reportedBy: 'user456', reason: 'groupChat', timestamp, conversationId },
    { reportedBy: 'user789', reason: 'workspace', timestamp, workspaceId }
  ],
  spamBanned: false // Set to true when active strikes >= 5
}
```

**Decay Logic:**

```typescript
// When checking strikes, filter out strikes older than 1 month
function getActiveStrikes(user: User): number {
  const oneMonthAgo = Date.now() - (30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  const activeReports = user.spamReportsReceived.filter(
    report => report.timestamp.toMillis() > oneMonthAgo
  );
  return activeReports.length;
}

// Update spamStrikes and spamBanned based on active count
// Clean old reports from array periodically
```

### 6.2 Prevention Measures

- **Rate limiting:** Max 20 invitations per day per user
- **Verification:** Email verification required to create workspaces
- **Warning system:**
  - Notification at 3 active strikes: "⚠️ You have 3 spam reports. Be careful - 5 strikes will restrict workspace/group creation."
  - Notification at 4 active strikes: "⚠️ You have 4 spam reports. One more will restrict your account."
  - Notification at 5 strikes: "🚫 Your account is restricted from creating workspaces and group chats due to spam reports."
- **Decay notification:** When a strike expires: "✅ A spam strike from 30+ days ago has been removed. You now have X active strikes."

---

## 7. User Profile & Status

### 7.1 Overview

The User Profile screen provides users with a central location to:

- View their account status (Free, Trial, or Pro)
- See what Pro features they have access to
- Manage their subscription
- Access account actions (upgrade, start trial)

The profile is accessible from **all tab screens** via a circular button in the top-right corner displaying the user's initials.

### 7.2 Profile Button

**Location:** Top-right corner of all tab screens (Chats, New Chat, Workspaces, Profile)

**Appearance:**

- Circular button (36x36px)
- Displays user initials (1-2 characters)
- Background color: `#007AFF` (primary blue)
- Text color: white
- Border: 2px white border for contrast

**States:**

- **Normal:** Blue background, white text, tap to navigate to profile
- **Selected:** When on profile screen, show visual indicator (e.g., `#005BBF` darker blue or border highlight)

**Initials Logic:** See [TASK-LIST-PHASE4.md, lines 1085-1106](./TASK-LIST-PHASE4.md#L1085-L1106)

### 7.3 Profile Screen UI

**Navigation:** Tab screen (hidden from tab bar), accessible only via profile button

**UI Schematic:**

```

### 7.4 Status Display Logic

**Status Badge & Action Buttons:** See [TASK-LIST-PHASE4.md, lines 1174-1238](./TASK-LIST-PHASE4.md#L1174-L1238) for complete implementation logic.

### 7.5 Feature List Display

**Content:** Copy exact feature list from `UpgradeToProModal.tsx` (AI Features + Workspace Features). Display for all user types to remind Pro users of features and motivate free users.

### 7.6 Subscription Management Screen (Future)

**Route:** `/subscription` (modal presentation)

**UI:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  ← Manage Subscription  [X] │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│                             │
│  Subscription Details       │
│                             │
│  Plan: Pro                  │
│  Price: $3/month            │

│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation:** Placeholder only - buttons disabled with "Coming soon" note

**Future Implementation:**

- Integrate with Stripe billing portal
- Handle cancellation flow (immediate or end of period)
- Update payment method
- View billing history

### 7.7 Implementation Sub-Phases

The User Profile feature is broken down into **4 logical sub-phases** for sequential implementation:

**See [TASK-LIST-PHASE4.md, Appendix A (lines 1067-1293)](./TASK-LIST-PHASE4.md#L1067-L1293) for:**

- Sub-Phase 4.1: Profile Button Component (1-2 hours)
- Sub-Phase 4.2: Profile Screen Structure (2-3 hours)
- Sub-Phase 4.3: Feature List & Action Buttons (2-3 hours)
- Sub-Phase 4.4: Subscription Management Screen (1-2 hours)

**Total:** 6-10 hours | **Order:** Sequential (4.1 → 4.2 → 4.3 → 4.4)

        );
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 10.2 Cloud Function Authorization

All AI Cloud Functions must validate:

```typescript
// Example: extractActionItems function
export const extractActionItems = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // 1. Auth check
  if (!context.auth) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('unauthenticated', 'Must be authenticated');
  }
  
  // 2. Get conversation
  const conversation = await getConversation(data.conversationId);
  
  // 3. Verify user is participant
  if (!conversation.participants.includes(context.auth.uid)) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('permission-denied', 'Not a participant');
  }
  
  // 4. Check AI feature access
  const user = await getUser(context.auth.uid);
  
  // Pro users can access AI everywhere
  if (user.isPaidUser) {
    // Proceed with AI extraction...
    return;
  }
  
  // Free users can only access AI in workspace chats
  if (conversation.workspaceId) {
    const workspace = await getWorkspace(conversation.workspaceId);
    if (workspace.members.includes(context.auth.uid)) {
      // Free user in workspace chat: allowed
      // Proceed with AI extraction...
      return;
    }
  }
  
  // Free user in personal chat: denied
  throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
    'permission-denied',
    'AI features require Pro subscription ($3/month) or workspace membership'
  );
});
```

     - 🔓 Free User (gray badge)
   - "Your Pro Features" section (copy from UpgradeToProModal)
   - Action buttons based on status:
     - **Free (no trial):** "Start 5-Day Free Trial" (if eligible) + "Upgrade to Pro"
     - **Free (in trial):** No buttons (trial active)
     - **Free (trial expired):** "Upgrade to Pro"
     - **Pro:** "Manage Subscription"

5. **Subscription Management Screen (Future)**
   - Create `app/subscription.tsx` (modal presentation)
   - Navigate from "Manage Subscription" button
   - Show two placeholder buttons:
     - "Change Payment Method" (disabled, coming soon)
     - "Cancel Subscription" (disabled, coming soon)

// Pro User
if (user.isPaidUser) {
  badge = "💎 Pro User"
  detail = `Expires: ${formatDate(user.subscriptionEndsAt)}`
  action = "Manage Subscription"
}

// Trial User
else if (user.trialEndsAt && now < user.trialEndsAt) {
  badge = "🎉 Trial User"
  detail = `${daysRemaining} days remaining`
  action = null // No button during trial
}

// Free User (trial expired or never had trial)
else {
  badge = "🔓 Free User"
  detail = null
  action = user.trialUsed ? "Upgrade to Pro" : "Start 5-Day Free Trial"
}
```

**Initials Logic:**

```typescript
function getInitials(displayName: string): string {
  if (!displayName) return '?';
  
  const words = displayName.trim().split(' ');
  
  if (words.length > 1) {
    // Multiple words: take first letter of first two words
    return (words[0][0] + words[1][0]).toUpperCase();
  } else {
    // Single word: take first letter only
    return words[0][0].toUpperCase();
  }
}

// Examples:
// "Adam Isom" → "AI"
// "John" → "J"
// "Bob Smith Jr" → "BS"
```

---

## 13. Future Enhancements

> **Note:** This section documents features that are out of scope for the initial Phase 4 implementation but may be valuable in future iterations.

### 13.1 Deferred Features from Phase 4

**Direct Chat Export on Workspace Deletion:**

- Currently: Workspace direct chats are deleted when workspace is deleted
- Future: Allow members to request email export of their direct chat history before deletion
- Implementation: Admin triggers deletion → System emails each member a PDF/JSON export of their direct chats → Wait 7 days → Delete workspace

**AI Content Edit History:**

- Currently: Admins can edit/save AI content, but only latest version is preserved (no history)
- Future: Keep version history for transparency and undo capability
- Implementation: Store edit history array with timestamps, editor UIDs, and previous versions
- UI: "View History" button shows changelog, "Revert to Version X" option

**Enhanced Enterprise Sales Funnel:**

- Currently: 25-member limit shows link to Twitter DM
- Future: Dedicated enterprise inquiry form with:
  - Team size input
  - Use case description
  - Contact information
  - Custom pricing calculator
  - Auto-email to sales team
  - CRM integration (HubSpot, Salesforce)

**Trial Extensions:**

- Currently: Hard 5-day trial, then AI locks to workspace chats only
- Future: Allow one 3-day extension if user is "close to converting" (e.g., used AI 10+ times)
- Future: Referral bonuses (invite 3 friends, get 1 month free Pro)

**Workspace Capacity Recommendations:**

- Currently: Basic UI guidance during workspace creation
- Future: Smart capacity recommendations based on:
  - User's email domain (fetch company size from Clearbit/LinkedIn)
  - Average group chat size
  - "Most teams your size choose 10-15 members"

**Spam Strike Appeals:**

- Currently: No appeals process, 1-month decay only
- Future: "Request Review" button for users who feel unfairly flagged
- Manual review by support team
- Evidence submission (screenshots, context)

### 12.1 Payment Integration (Stripe)

**Setup:**

1. Install Stripe SDK: `npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-react-native`
2. Create Stripe account, get API keys
3. Set up products:
   - Pro Plan: $3/month recurring
   - Workspace Add-On: $0.50/user/month metered billing

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// Cloud Function: createCheckoutSession
export const createCheckoutSession = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY);
  
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    customer: context.auth.uid,
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [{
      price: 'price_pro_monthly', // $3/month
      quantity: 1,
    }],
    mode: 'subscription',
    success_url: 'messageai://payment/success',
    cancel_url: 'messageai://payment/cancel',
  });
  
  return { sessionId: session.id };
});

// Cloud Function: handleWorkspaceBilling (runs monthly)
export const handleWorkspaceBilling = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('0 0 1 * *') // First day of month
  .onRun(async () => {
    const workspaces = await db.collection('workspaces').get();
    
    for (const workspace of workspaces.docs) {
      const data = workspace.data();
      const charge = data.maxUsersThisMonth * 0.50; // $0.50 per user
      
      await stripe.invoiceItems.create({
        customer: data.adminStripeId,
        amount: charge * 100, // Cents
        currency: 'usd',
        description: `Workspace: ${data.name} (${data.maxUsersThisMonth} users)`
      });
      
      // Reset counter for new month
      await workspace.ref.update({ maxUsersThisMonth: data.members.length });
    }
  });
```

**Webhooks:**

- `payment_intent.succeeded` → Set `isPaidUser: true`
- `payment_intent.failed` → Set workspace read-only
- `customer.subscription.deleted` → Cancel subscription, schedule deletion

## 14. Open Questions & Decisions

### Decisions Made

✅ **Pricing:** $3/month Pro + $0.50/user/month Workspace  
✅ **AI Access:** Pro users everywhere, free users ONLY in workspace chats (sales funnel)  
✅ **Admin pre-selects workspace capacity** (2-25 members, pays for all seats)  
✅ **Pro-rated billing** for mid-month signups and expansions  
✅ **MVP:** Instant free upgrades (no real payment), 500 user limit on signup  
✅ **One admin per workspace** (no transfer, no co-admins)  
✅ **5 workspace limit per user** (decrements on deletion)  
✅ **25 member limit** per workspace/group (enterprise link: <https://x.com/adam__isom>)  
✅ **Spam strikes: 5** (permanent, global, disables workspace/group creation)  
✅ **Spam reports:** Only at invitation stage (not after joining)  
✅ **Payment lapse:** Read-only → 30-day deletion  
✅ **Direct chat access:** Lost when member leaves/removed/workspace deleted  
✅ **Edit AI content:** No original preservation (single saved version only)  
✅ **My Tasks:** Per-workspace + non-workspace views (Pro users only)  
✅ **Workspace names:** Must be unique per user  
✅ **Workspace notifications:** Push + in-app, deleted after 24h when read  
✅ **Billing cycle:** 1st of month for everyone
✅ **Billing start timing:** Pro-rated from creation date (unless created on 1st)  
✅ **Downgrades:** Take effect next billing cycle (no pro-rated refunds)  
✅ **Direct chat removal:** Hard delete from conversation list (security rules prevent access)  
✅ **Trial limitations:** Cannot create workspaces during trial (Pro subscription required)

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should we offer annual plans (discount)?
- [ ] Should workspace admins see member activity stats?
- [ ] Should we allow workspace name changes?
- [ ] Should we add workspace icons/branding?
- [ ] Should workspace direct chats have separate notification settings?

## Appendix B: Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path - Create Workspace

1. User upgrades to Pro ($3/month)
2. Creates workspace "Marketing Team"
3. Invites 3 members via email
4. Members receive notifications
5. Members accept invitations
6. Workspace shows 4 members
7. Admin creates group chat "Q1 Planning"
8. All members auto-added to chat
9. Admin uses AI features
10. Members use AI features (free users)

**Expected Result:** ✅ All users can access AI in workspace

### Scenario 2: Admin Assigns Action Item

1. Admin opens "Q1 Planning" chat
2. Taps AI menu → Action Items
3. AI extracts 3 action items
4. Admin taps "Assign" on first item
5. Selects "Alice" from picker
6. Item shows "Assigned to: Alice"
7. Alice receives notification
8. Alice opens app, sees task in "My Tasks"

**Expected Result:** ✅ Assignment persists, syncs across devices

### Scenario 3: Free User Paywall

1. Free user opens personal direct chat
2. Taps AI menu → "Thread Summary"
3. Sees "Upgrade to Pro" modal
4. Cannot access feature

**Expected Result:** ✅ Paywall prevents access

### Scenario 4: Spam Reporting

1. User A invites User B to workspace
2. User B receives invitation
3. User B taps "Report Spam"
4. Confirms report
5. User A's spam strikes: 1
6. User A invites 4 more users (all report spam)
7. User A's spam strikes: 5
8. User A tries to create new workspace → Error
9. User A tries to create group chat → Error

**Expected Result:** ✅ User A banned from workspace/group creation

### Scenario 5: Payment Lapse

1. Admin's payment fails (simulated in MVP with dummy payment service)
2. Workspace becomes read-only immediately
3. Members can view messages
4. Members cannot send messages
5. AI features disabled
6. Admin receives notification
7. Admin updates payment method
8. Payment succeeds
9. Workspace becomes active again
10. Full functionality restored

**Expected Result:** ✅ Workspace read-only when payment fails, restored when payment succeeds (no deletion)

### Scenario 6: Workspace Member Limit

1. Admin creates workspace
2. Adds 24 members (total: 25 with admin)
3. Tries to add 26th member
4. Pop-up appears: "Limit reached. Teams larger than 25 members require our Enterprise plan. [Contact Sales]"
5. Admin clicks [Contact Sales]
6. Opens email client with pre-filled enterprise inquiry

**Expected Result:** ✅ Hard limit enforced, enterprise inquiry initiated

## Next Steps

1. **Review & Approve:** Developer reviews this PRD, asks clarifying questions
2. **Create Task List:** Break down implementation into detailed tasks
3. **Set Timeline:** Assign estimates, determine sprint cadence
4. **Begin Phase 1:** Start with data model and basic workspace CRUD
5. **Iterate:** Weekly check-ins to adjust based on learnings

**Estimated Total Implementation:** 3-4 weeks (full-time development)
